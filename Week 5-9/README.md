# Aaron's CEBD 1100 Week 9 Submission

This is my implementation of the K-MEANS technique learned in class with manual selection of centroids for each cluster. For each point, the Euclidean distance to each centroid is calculated and then each point is designeted to its closest centroid or "cluster". This designation is a new column in the dataframe and also serves to choose a colour for the final clustering graph.
